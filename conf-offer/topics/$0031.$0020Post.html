<p>As a Marketing Manager, I want to enable our Partners to send us Event Offers.</p>

<p>Offers provide Options for Talks (Speaking Opportunities), and Exhibits. &nbsp;These include Costs.</p>

<p>Acceptance Criteria:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Partner can post with this information</li>
	<li>This information is stored in a local database, and</li>
	<li>Can be reviewed in a Web App, which enables users to mark Talks/Exhibits as Used, and approve offers</li>
</ol>
